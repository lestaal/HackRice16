            <em>Gameplay</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Your goal is to make a tunnel at least 2 blocks wide to the bottom of the screen in order to escape and level up</li>
                <li>A row of random blocks will generate at the bottom of the screen every once in a while, pushing all blocks towards the top, so move fast!</li>
                <li>All pieces are the same as classic Tetris except for the black 1x1 bomb piece. This piece destroys every block adjacent to it.</li>
            </ul>
